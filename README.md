Kontainer Engine LKE Driver
===============================

This is the Kontainer-Engine Linode Driver. It is used in conjunction with the [ui-cluster-driver-lke.](https://github.com/linode/ui-cluster-driver-lke)

### Packaging and distributing


## Building

`make`

Will output driver binaries into the `dist` directory, these can be imported 
directly into Rancher and used as cluster drivers.  They must be distributed 
via URLs that your Rancher instance can establish a connection to and download 
the driver binaries.  For example, this driver is distributed via a GitHub 
release and can be downloaded from one of those URLs directly.

## Running

Go to the `Cluster Drivers` management screen in Rancher and click 
`Add Cluster Driver`. Enter the URL of your driver, a UI URL (see the UI 
[ui-cluster-driver-lke](https://github.com/linode/ui-cluster-driver-lke) for details), and a 
checksum (optional), and click `Create`. Rancher will automatically download 
and install your driver. It will then become available to use on the 
`Add Cluster` screen.

## Testing

This project contains a simple integration test suite to ensure the driver is working as 
expected against the Linode API.

In order to run the test suite, you will first need to create a 
[Linode Personal Access Token](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/api/guides/manage-api-tokens/)
and export it in your shell as the `LINODE_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
export LINODE_TOKEN=YOURTOKENHERE
```

From here you can run the following command to run the integration test suite:

```bash
make test
```
